AutoPlay
========

When you connect your audio jack to your phone, it's mostly because you want to play music. It's annoying to have to unlock your phone, go to the music player and hit play.

This app detects when the jack is connected, wakes the screen and shows a dialog on top of the lock screen which asks you if you want to play music.
If you accept it launches your default music player.

You can also configure the app to start playing music directly instead of asking with a dialog.
